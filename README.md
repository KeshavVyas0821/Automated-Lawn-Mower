# Automated-Lawn-Mower
The IoT-Based Automatic Lawn Mower is an innovative smart lawn maintenance system that integrates voice commands, Bluetooth control, and obstacle avoidance to enhance efficiency and automation. It allows users to operate the mower using voice commands via a smartphone or a Bluetooth-enabled mobile application, providing flexibility and ease of use. Equipped with ultrasonic sensors, it autonomously detects and avoids obstacles, ensuring smooth navigation without human intervention. The system is powered by a microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi), controlling motors and sensors, while Bluetooth modules enable wireless connectivity. Designed for energy efficiency, the mower runs on a rechargeable battery, making it an eco-friendly alternative to traditional gas-powered models. With IoT capabilities, the system can be further enhanced for remote monitoring, automated scheduling, and cloud-based data tracking. Future improvements could include GPS-based navigation, AI-driven path optimization, and real-time monitoring, making it a smart, autonomous, and efficient solution for modern lawn care.
